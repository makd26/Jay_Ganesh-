    Kesariwada Ganapati is the 5th respected Ganapati in Pune. Since its inception in 1894, the Kesari Trust’s Ganesh festival used to be organised at Vinchurkar Wada, off Kumthekar Road, which was then the ancestral home of the Tilaks. Then in 1905, it was shifted to Gaikwad Wada, presently known as Kesariwada.
    <br>
    <br>
    Founded by Lokmanya Tilak, the Kesari Wada retains its century-old tradition and is considered as one of the most respected Ganesh mandals of the city. The mandal as a tradition does not display decoration but emphasises on organisation of cultural events and educational programmes it attracts a large number of devotees. The mandal also celebrate its Ganesh festival which is held on the basis of the Tilak Panchang. Earlier, the mandal celebrated the festival from Vinchuarkar Wada, but later in 1902 it was shifted to Gaikwad Wada (also known as Kesari Wada) and since then it has been following the tradition. Like the first two Kasaba and Tambdi Jogeshwari, the Kesari Wada Ganpati also has the honour of a palkhi (palanquin). Some claim that initially Kesari Wada was third in the procession but later on it moved to fifth to make way for Guruji Talim and Tulshibaug.
    <br>
    <br>
    Through Kesari Public Ganeshotsav Board, Kesariwada started the public Ganesh Utsav since 1894. Lokmanya Tilak was living in the Vankurar Desert at that time. Later, since 1905 Kaiseriwada started celebrating the Kesari institution. Lokmanya Tilak's lectures were there. Even today, tradition has been preserved from the palanquin procession of Kesariwada.
