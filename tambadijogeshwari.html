  <p>    The Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav (Festival) of Pune which was introduced by Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak in 1893 is now celebrating its 125th year. The ganeshotsav of Pune is very popular not only in Maharashtra but all over India and is also acknowledged all over the globe due to its various Highlights. Kasba Ganapati is known as the “Gramdaivat” of Pune while Tambdi Jogeshwari is known as the “Gramdevata” of Pune. Lokmanya Tilak himself had given the Honor of Manacha Dusara Ganapati to Tambdi Jogeshwari Ganeshotsav Mandal as it is the “Gramdevata” from the very beginning of the utsav. i.e. in 1893. Our Mandal is celebrating the Ganesh Festival from 1893 in a traditional and most disciplined manner. Its history and main features are mentioned below.    
<br>
<br>
   Every year the Ganesh idol of the mandal is immersed and a new replica is made. An interesting point to note about the Ganesh Idol is its sculptor Shri. D.M Gulunkar, a well known artist from Pune who has sculpted the idol as is right from the beginning.This legacy is now carried forward by the 4th generation of the Gulunjkar family. Another feature of Ganesh idol is that the face of the idol is in resemblance of the African Elephant. The beauty and liveliness of the Ganesh idol grows brighter during the Ganeshotsav. We indeed feel that it comes to Life and watches over us.
   <br>
   <br>
          Since 1893 i.e. pre independence days of the country, many musical groups (known as “Mela”) had participated in the utsav. These Melas used to start their shows in front of Tambdi Jogeshwari (Gramdevata). Mela was variety entertainment programs through which guidance was given to people for freedom fighting. During this tenure i.e. from 1893 till 1940 participation in festival was mainly from family members of Bendre & Ghorpadkar family who were trustees of Jogeshwari Devasthan along with other citizens from the area surrounding Jogeshwari Mandir.
          <br>
          <br>
          After 1940, local citizens around the Jogeshwari Temple joined the Bendre and Ghorpadkar family to celebrate Ganeshotsav and it included families of Jejurikar Bros, Bodas Bros, Mimicry Artist Shri.Bhonde Thakurdesai, Advocate Gupte, Painter Bedekar, Chavan Bros, Wagh Bros. Shamsingh Pardeshi, Kulkarni and sons, Buva Icecreamwale, Ganpatrao Shevale, Rambhau Gokhale etc. During the next tenure i.e. 1940 to 1969 program of Melas was overtaken by musical concerts and famous artists like Hirabai Badodekar, Saraswati Rane, Sureshbabu Mane, Suresh Haldankar, Basavraj Rajguru, Jyostna Bhole, etc. who given their performances.
          <br>
         Thereafter since 1969, a new generation of volunteers took active part in the mandal. This includes Sarvashri G.B. Datar, Samak Bros., Gadgil Bros., Parundekar Bros. Tikhe Bros., Khangaonkar Bros. Sidhaye Bros., Gokhale Bros., Wakde Bros., Kulkarni Bros., Tikar Bros., Virendra Patankar, Pimputkar Bros., Suresh Lavalekar, Bal Mahadik, Ulhas Karyekar, Rambhau Neurgaonkar, Anant Deshpande, Bapu Soman, Prakash Bhonde, Bodas Bros etc.
         <br>
         <br>
          From the year 1992 the youngsters like sarvashri Rajabhau Tikar, Prasad Kulkarni, Saurabh Dhadphale, Prasad Patwardhan, Kedar Karmarkar, Raju Bawdekar, Abhijit Thakur, Vinit Ekbote, Atul Kulkarni, Borgaonkar Bros. Deshpande family, Avinash Sabne etc. joined the mandal as active karyakartas for celebrating the Ganeshotsav. A female members of the above mentioned volunteers’ family have also participated actively. We are pleased to mention that due to overwhelming response and devoted support from the all above, the face and pattern of Ganeshotsav of mandal has become wider, social and glamorous after 1969 and it continues to grow  till date.
          <br>
From 1969 noted singers like Sarvashri Jitendra Abhisheki, Ramdas Kamath, Sau. Jaymala   Shiledar, Kirti Shiledar have performed the musical recitals as well as Swaranand group have presented patriotic songs of Veer Savarkar in the Ganeshotsav of Mandal. The Mandal has installed one metal and wooden Devhara for the Ganesh idol. During the utsav   the spiritual programs like Ganeshyag, Shrisuktapathan etc. are being conducted regularly.
