  <div id="history">
  <p>"Azad Nagar Sarvajanik Utsav Samiti was established way back in the year 1966, 52 years ago, by the blue collared workers of Golden Tobacco Company, Tata Special Steel and Excel Industries Ltd. These people had moved from the Lalbaug. Parel bastion and settled in Andheri west, Azad Nagar M.H.B Colony, closer to their factories in which they worked. M.K. Menon, Tukaram Salaskar, Vasudev Kasalkar, etc. were the founder members who started this Ganeshotsav.
    <br>
<br>
Earlier the life size sculpture of Shri Ganesha was immersed on Anant Chaturdashi day along with the smaller version (Pooja idol). This was only in 1975, when the then Chairman of Samiti Shri Appa Khanvilkar whose wish was fulfilled by this Shri Ganpati, the Ganpati came to be known as "Navasala Pavnara Ganpati" (wish fulfilling Ganesha) who was also later known as "Andhericha Raja" (King of Andheri) by the entire Mumbai.
<br>
<br>
Once there was a long lasting strike in one of the company where these Mandal’s devotees were working. They urged this Ganesha for favourable outcome of strike. Their wish was fulfilled and as promised, they started immersion of life size idols on "Sankashti Day" which comes 5 days after "Anant Chaturdashi". On the demand of the people from Andheri, the immersion procession is routed through entire Andheri village. The procession usually begins at 5’O clock in the evening and reach sea shore by next day morning. Lacs of people attend it with their own arrangements for music, lighting, Prasadum etc.
<br>
<br>
The smaller version of the pooja idol is immersed on a particular day called "Anant Chaturdashi".
<br>
Samiti has completed 52 years of traditional celebration of Ganesh Utsav.<br>
Azad Nagar Sarvajanik Utsav Samiti presents Navshala Pavnara Andheri Cha Raja, also referred as the Lalbaugh Cha Raja of the Mumbai suburbs. Andheri Cha Raja mandal was established in 1966 by the workers of Tata Special Steel and Excel Industries Ltd.<br>
<br>
Every year the beautiful decorations and the unique themes of the pandal attracts a major crowd of devotees across the country, however, the mandal maintains a strict rule in terms of dress code. The mandal doesn't allow male and female devotees to wear shorts or mini skirts.<br>
<br>
What makes this Ganpati idol different from the rest is that it is immersed after 16 days instead of the usual 10th day for other Ganpati idols. This means the Ganpati stays up to Shakasti ie after Anath Chaturti.<br>
<br>
Several Bollywood movie stars and other notable celebs, like Priyanka Chopra, Shilpa Shetty family, Ravina Tandon, Nana Patekar, Anil Kapoor, Shatrughan Sinha, Alka Yagnik, and Bappi Lahiri frequent at the mandal. Several political leaders also seek blessings from Andheri Cha Raja.<br>
<br>
The mandal spokesperson Uday Salian boasts that the Andheri Cha Raja has the TM certificate exclusively from the government of India and has bagged first prize from fire and security association of India. It has 24 CCTV cameras and all kinds of insurance.<br>
<br>
Andheri Cha Raja mandal, which consists of more than 600 volunteers, is headed by the Chairman Keshav Tondvalkar, secretary Vijay Sawant and Pramukha Margadarshak Yeshodhar Padmakar Phanse. Art direction of the mandal has been done by Darmesh Shah and Prashil.<br>
